# Natural Language Processing Course Notes

Jupyter notebook lab code solutions for the NLP module ECS763.

Solutions include the following:
* 1. An N-gram MLE mode implementing Lidstone (add-k) and Kneser-Ney smoothing.
* 2. A k-fold cross validation algorithm to learn to classify Amazon reviews as 'real' or 'fake'.
* 3. A CRF (Conditional Random Field) and HMM (Hidden Markov Model) POS (Part Of Speech) tagger.
* 4. The final project to implement a variety of language techniques to classify lines in a TV script according to the character who spoke them, and measure the accuracy of the classifier built.
